# SimpleDictionary

SimpleDictionary is an English dictionary Android application written in Java. It was developed as a final project in 50:198:325 (Java Applications) at Rutgersâ€“Camden in Spring 2022. It allows a user to search for English words and find definitions, parts of speech, example sentences, and synonyms. Word data comes from the WordsAPI API. Users can view the words they've searched for, which does not incur any additional API requests as word data is stored locally in a SQLite database with each query.
